                "narrative": "PHI WP1 and WP2 are complementary and will address the critical gaps in diagnostics and surveillance methods, data access and sharing, and risk assessment tools and preparedness strategies to address current and future biotic threats to plant health. By creating a common platform, in collaboration with national, regional, and transcontinental partners, for data sharing, standardized tools and methods for diagnostics, surveillance and P&D modelling, and risk assessment, a global diagnostic and surveillance network will be established. This network will generate scientific knowledge on invasive and emerging P&D and will appropriately guide WP3 and WP4 teams in effectively managing plant health threats in the targeted agri-food systems (AA OC1 & AA OC2).\nWP3 is at the core of the Initiative provides smallholder farmers in the targeted LMICs with IPDM packages to tackle prioritized P&D while building the capacity of national partners in developing functional R4D pipelines to create and deliver new IPDM innovations to face emerging plant health threats. Outputs from WP1 and WP2 will continuously inform WP3 on what specific IPDM innovations to focus on or to modify in the face of changing climates, and farming systems. Complementing WP3 further down the food value chain, WP4 will address mycotoxin contamination by creating integrated management practices and ensuring wider adoption of available innovations, such as Aflasafe, by working closely with scaling partners, especially the private sector. Together, WP3 and WP4, in collaboration with scaling partners and complementary OneCGIAR initiatives, will contribute to creating resilient and inclusive agri-food systems (AA OC2 & OC3).\nWP5, a cross-cutting work package, will conduct interdisciplinary research to provide tools, approaches, and methodologies to ensure inclusive and equitable impacts by considering specific needs of women, youth, and vulnerable groups, a functional interface between biophysical and social scientists, knowledge sharing among plant health researchers and downstream partners, and evidence-based policy briefs on plant health threats for decision-makers to create an enabling environment that promotes IPDM and integrated mycotoxin management (IMM). These actions will strengthen the outcomes from WP1 to WP4 and ensures that the Initiative effectively contributes to the greater resilience of farming systems to biotic threats and changing climates (AA OC4 & OC5).\nThe EoI Outcomes will contribute to five AA Outcomes, and thereby to the CGIAR global collective targets by 2030. Nutrition, health, and food security will be improved by reducing losses to crop yield and quality caused by P&D, and contamination by mycotoxins. New jobs will be created through stronger public-private partnerships, thereby alleviating poverty. Adoption of plant health innovations will give farmers enhanced capacity to adapt to the changing climates and the consequent effects on the P&D spectrum and intensity in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. This will also result in reduced use of toxic pesticides and preservation of the environment and biodiversity (including natural enemies of the pests/pathogens). Strong focus on gender and social inclusion will ensure that the PH innovations have equitable and inclusive benefits, especially for women, youth and vulnerable groups.",

                "description": "Full Proposal ISDC Feedback",
                "narrative": "UU will support climate-resilient agricultural livelihoods and agribusiness ecosystems in 12 ESA countries to help millions of vulnerable smallholders transition from maize-mixed systems to sustainably intensified, diversified, and de-risked agri-food systems. Targeted to address seven key SDG goals (See 6.1), the focus of this Initiative is improving public and private extension and delivery channels enabled by the agribusiness ecosystem, private investment, policy coherence and institutional coordination. Whilst the public sector will continue to play a strong role, the private sector will also be key to realizing the necessary scale of adaptation. Tapping new capital sources to support this will require the developments that deliver again environment and governance metrics alongside traditional economic and calorie source drivers.   \n\nUU’s theory of change (ToC) is operationalized through three impact pathways:  \n\nAssess – providing evidence through various integrated assessments. \n\nApply – implementing innovations, management practices, and business models. \n\nScale – scaling out to more people or areas, scaling up through policies and institutions, and scaling deep to create behavioral changes. \n\nThese pathways link UU’s four main WPs (WP1-4) and two cross-cutting ones (WP5-6) to deliver through a systems approach. UU research and testing will underpin the co-design of diversification and intensification STI-Bs, including improved varieties, climate-smart SI practices, and sustainable water and land management of maize-mixed systems, all of which have clear market demand and are delivered through innovative extension mechanisms as part of WP1. Given the scale of change needed and budgetary limits, links with other initiatives – including Sustainable Intensification, EiA, SAPLING, Sustainable Healthy Diets through Food Systems Transformation (SHiFT), Nexus Gains, and Rethinking Markets – will strengthen the STI-Bs developments. An important supporting component will be the digital agro-advisory services and ARM products co-designed and delivered to farmers through innovative multimedia channels as part of WP2. A value chain and food systems approach will be used to identify key market gaps and opportunities, and from that support for SMEs will be developed, through technical assistance and acceleration through enterprise support organizations (ESOs) in WP3. Farmers will be supported in their efforts to diversify and intensify through technology transfer of STI-Bs, access to inputs, farm management services, information services, and market linkages. This process will build on existing incubation capabilities in ESA countries and CGIAR and will help unlock sustainable finance from public and private sources, such as the Climate-Smart Food Systems Fund being launched this year by CGIAR. New STI-B developments need to be supported by a conducive enabling environment (WP4) supporting inclusive (WP5) scaling (WP6). Activities in WP4 such as policy dialogue and the ESA Learning Platform will help foster an enabling policy and investment environment to this end. These 4 WPs each identify a Big Five of proven innovations, technologies, enablers, and interventions that have been prioritized as ‘quick wins’ to achieve impact at scale. \n\nA strong focus on empowering women and youth is integrated throughout all WPs by a GESI-informed framework (WP5). It will build an understanding of barriers to agency and restrictive social norms in agri-enterprises, and strengthen capacity through change-agent identification, mentorships, and trainings. Cross-cutting WP6, meanwhile, will establish a Scaling Hub to bring together demand, innovation, and partners to scale fit-for-purpose STI-Bs through innovative delivery models. WP6 will provide a regional mechanism for spill-over scaling from other One CGIAR initiatives and partner programs.  ",

                "description": "The Genebanks Initiative will address SDG 2.5 and support the global system for the conservation and use of PGRFA. CGIAR genebanks manage collections of more than 20 staple crops in ten locations across five continents. The collections are made freely available upon request to thousands of users worldwide every year under the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (Plant Treaty), accounting for a large amount of the germplasm being exchanged under the multilateral system of access and benefit-sharing. This Initiative will support long-term conservation activities at international standards, develop improved protocols and practices to improve efficiency and future-proof the genebanks and germplasm health units (GHUs). In collaboration with CGIAR researchers and breeders, the Initiative will characterize and help evaluate the usefulness of genebank materials for crop improvement. Working together with strategic partners such as the Global Crop Diversity Trust (Crop Trust), Plant Treaty Secretariat and other international and national genebanks, the Initiative will strengthen the global system. The Initiative will co-develop capacity building programs with these partners, promoting coordination, responsibility-sharing, and the development of, and compliance with, supportive policies.",
                "narrative": "The four Work Packages (WPs) are similar to the Modules in the current Genebank Platform, with an increased focus on developing tools and resources to promote use of crop diversity and more support for collaboration and building National Agricultural Research System (NARS) capacity. 1) WP 1 comprises routine genebank operations and curation of collections of 23 crops to ensure germplasm viability, health, and availability in the long-term as well as for immediate use. The outputs will ensure genebanks are able to distribute, in compliance with legal obligations, disease-free, well documented germplasm to diverse users in response to requests.\nWP 2 focuses on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of specific conservation (e.g. seed quality management, cryopreservation) and phytosanitary protocols that cause chronic bottlenecks or inefficiencies in processes or risk management. This WP will also ensure that CGIAR perspectives are represented in international policy-making processes. WP 2 builds on CGIAR’s areas of expertise not only to futureproof the collections and the way CGIAR functions within the international policy environment, but to feed into NARS capacity building efforts (which is the focus of WP 4).\nWP 3 goes beyond the genebank service of providing germplasm on request by supporting the active participation of collection curators in collaborative efforts to evaluate and discover traits required in product profiles and in response to priority activities to address the five Impact Areas. Outputs include PGRFA subsets tailored to specific traits and ready-made genetic resources for trait development. Data generated by research partners will be harnessed to add value to collections, which will increase interest in materials from users outside CGIAR and result in more germplasm requests in WP 1. WP 3 will enable researchers to utilize fully characterized germplasm to identify novel sources of genetic variation and mine collections (“Accelerated Breeding: Meeting Farmers needs with Nutritious, Climate-Resilient Crops”).\nBreeders will use landraces and wild relatives as sources of novel alleles to accelerate genetic gains for climate resilience, nutrition, and processing traits (“Accelerating crop improvement through precision genetic technologies”). Genebanks, through analyzing trends in germplasm requests, will feed new information into “Market Intelligence for More Equitable and Impactful Genetic Innovation.” Diverse users’ may also draw on genetic diversity for rangeland management (“Livestock Systems Climate and Resilience”).\nWhile WP 2 and 3 focus primarily on R&D in CGIAR Initiatives, WP 4 leverages the skills and innovations in WP 1-3 to strengthen capacities of key actors outside CGIAR. WP 4 will help define mutually supportive roles and responsibilities of CGIAR and partners to strengthen the global system and increase the coverage of PGRFA conserved and made available worldwide. CGIAR genebanks will work with NARS, National Plant Protection Organizations, regional networks, universities, seed industry and international policy-making bodies to source and conserve threatened or useful diversity (including fruit and vegetable diversity), co-develop conservation strategies, policy instruments, and training materials to promote efficiencies and responsibility-sharing.",

                "title": "Accelerating Crop Improvement Through Genome Editiong (GEdI)",
                "description": "Feeding the world population of 8.5 billion by 2030 will require improved sustainable production to increase yields of more nutritious and higher quality foods that are accessible for the world’s most vulnerable populations. The growing demand for food will make the current production losses intolerable  with pressures on food security further compounded by predicted climate induced productivity decline   . Conventional breeding has made significant advancements, demonstrating impressive levels of impact from genetic solutions for smallholders in developing countries . Nevertheless, conventional breeding alone will not generate the step-change in yields required to meet future demand for high quality, nutritious food. A major technical drawback of conventional breeding is the inability to precisely select traits without including undesirable ‘co-segregating’ traits from donor lines (genetic linkage drag). Efforts to remove undesirable traits are never fully successful and require additional breeding cycles, prolonging the process, adding costs, and delaying benefit realization. \nGenome editing (GEd) is a cost- and time-effective solution that can strategically complement conventional breeding . GEd enables precise and predictable refinement of crop genomes   . GEd can be done in elite breeding lines and commercial varieties, enabling quick and cheap delivery of essential traits to users . GEd is being used in more than 40 crops across 25 countries, with six GEd crop varieties (soybean, canola, rice, maize, mushroom and camelina) approved for commercialization .\nDespite the significant step-change in impact achievable through GEd and recent positive regulatory trends in many countries (including Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, Kenya, Nigeria, India, and the Philippines), debate and regulatory developments are ongoing. However, the discussion has shifted to a need for a sensible and pragmatic appreciation of benefits and risks, with a call to balance caution and innovation, recognizing that “governance must cope with a moving technical frontier” . Statements from the G20 Agricultural Scientists (2021) and the European Commission (2021) affirmed the potential for New Genomic Techniques (NGT) to make valuable contributions to food security and environmental sustainability, concluding that “any further policy action should be aimed at reaping benefits from innovation while addressing concerns” . Generally, within-species genetic changes using GEd are more readily accepted than transgenic innovations.\nThe Genome Editing Initiative (GEdI) takes a holistic and long-term view of growing future demand for GEd solutions as experience with the technology and social acceptance grows. Complementary innovations to support high standards of product stewardship, guide intellectual property management, facilitate licensing, encourage enabling societal and policy environments, and support delivery of GEd products to market have been included in Work Package 1 (WP1). Capacity building across NARS, SMEs and ARIs, collaborating partners in Work Package 2 (WP2), is designed to position these networks to use GEd more efficiently, effectively, and responsibly while building local innovation understanding and acceptance across socio-political landscapes. This will contextualize and promote equitable access and research spillovers, generating significant future benefits and minimizing future technological disadvantages   . Work Package (WP3) has identified exogenous DNA-free GEd innovations with potential for transformative scales of impact that are in demand by partners who are enthusiastic for GEd enabled benefits (Annex 1 and Annex 2). As one prominent government official said at the planning consultation for this Initiative, “it will be important to harness the power of precision genetics, mainly genome editing, to deliver products that reduce hunger and poverty, and address actual needs of humanity” (Annex 3).\n",
                "narrative": "GEdI aims “to deliver genetic solutions that are difficult to achieve with conventional breeding technologies, generating a step-change in the targeted Impact Areas”, i.e. SDGs (1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 12, 13). Impact will only occur when GEd innovations and the enabling social and governance policies and systems are in place, supporting varieties developed from GEd breeding lines to progress to market and use. Work Packages 1 and 2 will foster enabling environments, while Work Package 3 will develop GEd innovations.\nWP1 will establish a Research Enabling and Oversight (REO) Unit to provide strategic leadership on the current and future use of GEd, spanning the product lifecycle. The REO Unit will monitor global needs, maintain consultation with diverse stakeholders including regulators and seed systems, and undertake impact projections to inform rigorous Eschborn-aligned prioritization. WP1 will work alongside Market Intelligence and Accelerated Breeding to identify GEd opportunities that complement GI’s portfolio of conventional breeding. WP1 will establish a framework for successful GEd investment that can accommodate future GEd opportunities. These activities will achieve the EIO ‘CGIAR, NARS and SMEs use a strategic approach for scaling GEd innovations, including frameworks to mitigate risks and harness opportunities’, and contribute to the GI outcomes ‘CGIAR & partners use high quality market intelligence to guide the development of new varieties to meet the needs and expectations of a wide range of users, with special attention to marginalized groups’ and ‘cooperation & co-investment by CGIAR, public- and private-sector seed-system actors supports coordinated & effective research and investment in the sector’. \nWP2 will form expert-supported, gender and age diverse, cross organization Communities of Practice (COP) covering technical, social and policy aspects of the GEd product cycle. Learning and experience will be shared to co-develop best practice guidelines and supporting resources, building capacity of CGIAR’s partnered breeding network and achieving the EIO ‘NARS, end-users and policymakers are supported in using GEd as an option to address agricultural development constraints & opportunities’, and contributing to the GI outcome ‘CGIAR & partner breeding programs use state-of-the-art technologies to accelerate variety development and quality’.\nWP3 will progress identified priorities, to achieve both EIOs ‘NARS, ARIs and SMEs co-develop and jointly use GEd lines in breeding programs to efficiently achieve step-change gains for demand driven traits’ and 'NARS, ARIs, SMEs and decision-makers use GEd technology to incorporate the needs of women and youth in market-demanded products within agrifood systems’, significantly contributing to the GI outcome ‘Farmers have access to and use climate-resilient, nutritious, market-demanded crop varieties.’\nGEdI’s logic assumes that:\n•\tTechnical and non-technical innovations are needed to progress GEd innovations to market.\n•\tGEdI priorities will complement conventional breeding priorities, forming a unified portfolio.\n•\tThere are sufficient demand partners for GEd innovations, and they will be more effective if supported to develop and implement strategies to progress GEd innovations to market.\n•\tPartnering organizations will collaborate on common challenges to co-develop tools and resources for broader use.\n•\tGEd breeding lines will be accepted into conventional breeding programs.\n•\tIncreased pest and disease resistance will increase crop yields, improving food security and nutrition and reducing poverty. \n•\tIncreased pest and disease resistance will support better IPM with improvements for environmental health and biodiversity.\n•\tImproved translocation of nitrogen will reduce the need for fertilizers and other trait improvements, reducing methane greenhouse gas emissions.\n",

            "work_package_toc": "Crop varietal replacement has been slow partly due to uncoordinated efforts among breeding programs within and among CGIAR and partners. To achieve the EoI Outcomes 1 and 2, WP5 will develop scaling mechanisms for institutional change in CGIAR-NARES-SME breeding networks and monitor and assess impacts of the adoption of institutional standards across the five Impact Areas. Through the Genetic Innovation for Impact (G×I) learning alliance, WP5 will build partnerships and capacity both horizontally (via breeding networks) and vertically (through the transdisciplinary teams built in WP1, WP2 and WP3), which are scaled through the RIIs. WP5 will co-develop the Global Market Intelligence Platform with WP1 and Foresight and Metrics to support standardizing, crowdsourcing and sharing of market intelligence among Initiatives and partners, and within Regional, transdisciplinary CGIAR-NARES-SME teams. The G×I Learning Alliance will be co-developed with Accelerated Breeding and SeEdQUAL, and will provide a platform for CGIAR and partners (NARES, SMEs, WorldVeg, CIRAD, Cornell University, etc.) to share their experiences in implementing institutional innovations developed in WP2. Scaling of the platform through the RII will be monitored through an Innovation Packages and Scaling Readiness Plan (Section 4). Scaling will be supported by funding and partners’ shared interest in market intelligence and the tools needed to enhance their institutional capacity to increase the impact of genetic innovation. \n\nWP5’s MELIA team will contribute to WP1 to map global and regional challenges and impact potentials across the five Impact Areas, and to WP4 to conduct ex-ante impact assessment for pipeline investment cases. WP5 will use behavioral intelligence generated in WP3 to assess how this Initiative can scale variety adoption and accelerate varietal turnover, and leverage the experiments undertaken in WP3 for evaluating the ex-post impacts of improved varieties. WP5 will closely work with SeEdQUAL, SHiFT and FRESH Initiatives to evaluate impacts on farmers and consumers of varieties and related products from past breeding efforts that targeted socio-economic or gender-relevant traits. Clear demonstration of impacts will trigger the interest of CGIAR-NARES-SME breeding networks in enhancing their knowledge on the contribution of institutional change in genetic innovation to the five Impact Areas, driven by a shared interest in maximizing the impact of breeding programs. \n\nDriven by shared interests in exchanging information and increasing the returns to investment in genetic innovation, partners such as USAID Feed the Future Innovation Labs, universities (Flinders University, Innovative Genomics Institute at University of California, Berkeley, National University of Ireland Galway Ryan Institute) and projects and programs such as Gender-responsive Researchers Equipped for Agricultural Transformation (GREAT), Demand-Led Breeding (DLB), and Institutionalizing Monitoring of Crop Variety Adoption using Genotyping program (IMAGE) will be encouraged to be involved in WP5 to help scale the institutional innovation more widely across NARES and SMEs in and beyond prioritized CGIAR regions. These outcomes will contribute to AA Outcomes 2, 5, 7 and 8 and achieving them will require strong support from donors and strong willingness from partners to engage in exchange of information and collaboration. In the long run, WP5 is expected to lead to institutionalization of inclusive decision making in gender-intentional product profile design in genetic innovation systems, resulting in greater impacts of breeding efforts with spillovers outside the genetic innovation sphere.\n",

                "narrative": "Variety improvement is more than productivity gain. The varieties developed must deliver on the increasingly complex, multi-trait product profiles demanded by end-users if they are to be grown by small holders and impact SDGs. Climate adaptation brings additional requirements to product profiles to maintain production despite shifting pests and disease distributions and changing crop environments. Breeding for complex and multiple traits needs modern breeding methods. E.g. advanced scientific techniques such as genomic selection will allow multiple traits to be interrogated across diverse product profiles of climate adaptation, disease resistance, nutrition and others to be brought together in a timely fashion (Action Area Outcome, AAO). \nBreeding for climate change will also require accelerated variety development with varieties developed in the most recently experienced climate , creating demand for targeted phenotyping for stress traits using efficient remote technologies. Automation and semi-automation of data entry will allow more data to be collected, quicker and cheaper for biometrics and bioinformatics supported selection decisions. These technologies will result in quicker breeding and increased ability to develop the required products.\nN4ETTSS will improve breeding cost-effectiveness; that is the cost of breeding relative to the quality of the varieties produced, as judged by variety adoption (AAO). This assumes that varieties that deliver on in-demand, complex, multi-trait product profiles will be adopted by growers, and these varieties will deliver on the impact areas (supported by MIPP). \nPerformance monitoring will apply a corporate approach of taking responsibility for how products are produced (e.g. cost-effectiveness), and will complement the investor dashboard (MIPP WP4) which tracks the life cycle impacts of those products (i.e. real-world functioning). The approach assumes that transparent reporting will motivate ongoing improvements within breeding programs and track product delivery against the SDGs, including social, gender and environmental benefits of released varieties. This will further support N4ETTSS’ contribution to impactful varieties.\nThe benefits of TTSS will be realized when there is mainstream adoption across the CGIAR-NARS breeding network (lead by ABI). Under the guidance of a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), Modernization Facilitators (MF) will connect breeding programs with Specialized Technical Support (STS) teams to research and resolve TTSS technical barriers to adoption. Change management will facilitate the cultural shift and institutional reforms required for breeding programs to transform into dynamic multidisciplinary teams of experts.\nBreeding modernization is not a static end point. The TAC will contribute to ongoing prospecting for future TTSS and play an active role in fostering an advanced innovation ecosystem of public and private breeders, researchers and stakeholders (AAO). The innovation ecosystem will participate in breeding process research to ensure that best practice breeding continues to evolve, pushing forward the whole TTSS adoption curve while capacity building within the CGIAR-NARS breeding network will condense the adoption curve.\nN4ETTSS assumes that breeding work, without modernization, would continue at the same pace and with the same level of impact as achieved over the last 20 years. Adoption of TTSS will increase the speed of breeding and enable breeding to meet demands, bringing forward benefits and increasing the impacts compared to traditional breeding. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the more complex requirements posed by climate change or natural resources limited environments could be met by traditional breeding in a relevant timeframe.",

                "work_package_toc": "There are several options for modernizing breeding with competing technologies and tools available. Significant resources are invested in generating data across the CGIAR-NARS breeding network, however, growing misalignment between technologies and tools as programs individually modernize is fragmenting the network, threatening data compatibility and limiting research outcomes. A coordinated breeding network that can share knowledge across regions, needs compatible data for cross and meta-analyses. The need for such global and long-term data sets has never been so pressing. Climate change will require varieties to be assessed under forecast conditions to prioritize parents accordingly and historical and cross-regional breeding results can provide valuable, time saving insights, if the data is available and compatible. \nStrategic Modernization aims to guide informed investment in CGIAR-NARS modernization.  A TTSS Strategic Plan will be developed under the guidance of a multi-stakeholder Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (see WP5 for further details) and be informed by meta-analysis of ABI WP3 BPAT results and extensive regional input to create commitment and ownership. Broad support for the plan will reduce disparate investments in conflicting TTSS and align efforts to maximize the utility and legacy of all breeding research. The TTSS Strategic Plan is a major stage gate and will prompt refinement to all N4ETTSS WPs. The plan will deliver on the Eschborn principles of big lifts, rigorous priority setting, financial realism, transparency and embed principles such as defined success metrics in a shared agenda with stage-gating to further ensure improvements in breeding programs are maximized. \nCrucially, the plan will focus breeding program investments to a common set of TTSS and encourage adoption of TTSS, bringing forth the benefits of breeding modernization. These outcomes will assist ABI, as the main primary beneficiary of N4ETTSS, to maximize its impact on global challenges.\nA model of TTSS investment across the CGIAR-NARS network will inform the TTSS Strategic Plan by identifying the most appropriate package of TTSS for a unified, integrated CGIAR-NARS breeding network that connects with small to medium enterprises. The model will also inform more detailed projection of benefits and MELIA.\nModelling of TTSS in the CGIAR-NARS network will also develop consistent financial forecasting capability for breeding programs. N4ETTSS will harmonize the cost structure of operations across the CGIAR-NARS network. This will support global forecasting, program and portfolio scales of planning with responsiveness to changing demands (e.g. new product profiles) and informed capacity design by CGIAR management. Improved financial acumen will further enable management decisions that improve cost effectiveness of breeding and increase transparency in the value generated by funder investments. \nABI WP3, ABI WP5, EiB’s BPAT results, and this proposal’s regional consultation findings are important inputs to this WP. As ABI expands BPAT-like assessments and modernization plans to NARS, this WP will provide breeding simulations for individual breeding programs (see Annex A for examples). The simulations will inform breeding program decisions, increasing variety performance gains. The value of simulation has been validated at a smaller scale by the EiB Platform, which has piloted such support to champion programs within each crop. A team of quantitative geneticists and biometricians will engage with breeding teams to identify areas that can be improved and be translated into greater genetic and economic performance. The results will validate the benefits of simulations and further encourage TTSS adoption. ",

                "description": "The Genebanks Initiative will address SDG 2.5 and support the global system for the conservation and use of PGRFA. CGIAR genebanks manage collections of more than 20 staple crops in ten locations across five continents. The collections are made freely available upon request to thousands of users worldwide every year under the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (Plant Treaty), accounting for a large amount of the germplasm being exchanged under the multilateral system of access and benefit-sharing. This Initiative will support long-term conservation activities at international standards, develop improved protocols and practices to improve efficiency and future-proof the genebanks and germplasm health units (GHUs). In collaboration with CGIAR researchers and breeders, the Initiative will characterize and help evaluate the usefulness of genebank materials for crop improvement. Working together with strategic partners such as the Global Crop Diversity Trust (Crop Trust), Plant Treaty Secretariat and other international and national genebanks, the Initiative will strengthen the global system. The Initiative will co-develop capacity building programs with these partners, promoting coordination, responsibility-sharing, and the development of, and compliance with, supportive policies.",
                "narrative": "The four Work Packages (WPs) are similar to the Modules in the current Genebank Platform, with an increased focus on developing tools and resources to promote use of crop diversity and more support for collaboration and building National Agricultural Research System (NARS) capacity. 1) WP 1 comprises routine genebank operations and curation of collections of 23 crops to ensure germplasm viability, health, and availability in the long-term as well as for immediate use. The outputs will ensure genebanks are able to distribute, in compliance with legal obligations, disease-free, well documented germplasm to diverse users in response to requests.\nWP 2 focuses on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of specific conservation (e.g. seed quality management, cryopreservation) and phytosanitary protocols that cause chronic bottlenecks or inefficiencies in processes or risk management. This WP will also ensure that CGIAR perspectives are represented in international policy-making processes. WP 2 builds on CGIAR’s areas of expertise not only to futureproof the collections and the way CGIAR functions within the international policy environment, but to feed into NARS capacity building efforts (which is the focus of WP 4).\nWP 3 goes beyond the genebank service of providing germplasm on request by supporting the active participation of collection curators in collaborative efforts to evaluate and discover traits required in product profiles and in response to priority activities to address the five Impact Areas. Outputs include PGRFA subsets tailored to specific traits and ready-made genetic resources for trait development. Data generated by research partners will be harnessed to add value to collections, which will increase interest in materials from users outside CGIAR and result in more germplasm requests in WP 1. WP 3 will enable researchers to utilize fully characterized germplasm to identify novel sources of genetic variation and mine collections (“Accelerated Breeding: Meeting Farmers needs with Nutritious, Climate-Resilient Crops”).\nBreeders will use landraces and wild relatives as sources of novel alleles to accelerate genetic gains for climate resilience, nutrition, and processing traits (“Accelerating crop improvement through precision genetic technologies”). Genebanks, through analyzing trends in germplasm requests, will feed new information into “Market Intelligence for More Equitable and Impactful Genetic Innovation.” Diverse users’ may also draw on genetic diversity for rangeland management (“Livestock Systems Climate and Resilience”).\nWhile WP 2 and 3 focus primarily on R&D in CGIAR Initiatives, WP 4 leverages the skills and innovations in WP 1-3 to strengthen capacities of key actors outside CGIAR. WP 4 will help define mutually supportive roles and responsibilities of CGIAR and partners to strengthen the global system and increase the coverage of PGRFA conserved and made available worldwide. CGIAR genebanks will work with NARS, National Plant Protection Organizations, regional networks, universities, seed industry and international policy-making bodies to source and conserve threatened or useful diversity (including fruit and vegetable diversity), co-develop conservation strategies, policy instruments, and training materials to promote efficiencies and responsibility-sharing.",

The Accelerated Breeding Initiative is establishing trait development pipelines to systematically search and incorporate valuable diversity into breeding efforts. Hence, the focus of WP 3 is to create resources that connect with and facilitate throughput of those pipelines. The same resources will be useful in trait development efforts from other programs, whether inside or outside CGIAR.\nThe logical flow of information and resources is given in the accompanying diagram. The key beneficiary of genebank work is breeding and selection programs, both inside and outside CGIAR. These establish demand for the genetic diversity preserved in the genebanks. However, connecting this diversity to their programs faces challenges, both in terms of identifying valuable diversity, and in packaging that in a form the breeding programs can utilize. The activities described in WP 3 are aimed at enabling faster, more effective interrogation of genebank materials for useful diversity (phenotypic or allelic), creating genetic resources to relieve the bottlenecks associated with population development, and making such data and materials easily accessible to researchers. Together these activities will enable more efficient evaluation of genebank collections, thereby lowering barriers to Accelerated Breeding Initiative and external partners utilizing the collections.\nThe work of the Genebanks Initiative on enhanced use of germplasm extends beyond One CGIAR, particularly in terms of the direct use of non-mandated crops in partnerships with other actors involved in value chain development.",

                "narrative": "SeEdQUAL supports the delivery of seed of improved climate-resilient, market-preferred, and nutritious varieties of priority crops, embodying a high rate of genetic gain to farmers, ensuring that women and other disadvantaged groups get equitable access. In this sense, the initiative primarily supports the delivery of improved varieties from CG/NARS breeding networks and not the use of in-situ material, landraces and under-utilized crops. This important aspect of seed system development is promoted elsewhere within the One CGIAR R4D portfolio (RAFS).  \n \t\nSeed sector development is a complex and extensive area of work, and this proposal describes activities best suited to the comparative advantage of the One CGIAR vis-à-vis NARES, seed delivery and other development partners. Development outcomes, and ultimately impact, will largely be delivered through partnerships via aligned investments, including but not limited to, through the Crops to End Hunger (CtEH) Initiative. Many critical aspects of seed sector development, such as value-chain linkages, seed delivery partner capacity building, finance, and policy advocacy, will be undertaken by our partners and aligned initiatives (including One CGIAR Regionally Integrated Initiatives).  \n \nSeEdQUAL comprises six work packages. WPs 1-3 are the “engine-room” of SeEdQUAL, based around three principal crop archetypes requiring public support and investment. They will develop new EGS business models and undertake seed production research, alongside the evaluation and promotion of in-demand varieties emerging from breeding pipelines, in collaboration with and through NARES. Three cross-cutting WPs (4-6) will provide tools to manage and monitor variety advancement and adoption, coordinate capacity building, and build the evidence base for better seed policy and strategies for last-mile delivery to disadvantaged groups. \n \nThe causal logic driving impact and change is focus on fewer but better characterized and in-demand varieties will facilitate the hand-over of such varieties to seed delivery partners and ultimately farmers aligned to their wider societal context. More productive and cost-effective foundation seed production and business models will incentivize external investment in seed production, including critically, non-hybrid crops. Better seed policy advice, advocated by our development and industry body partners and implemented by national seed authorities, will lower the cost of business, thus incentivizing investment. Better targeted seed subsidies will drive varietal turnover and contribute to national policy agendas. Ultimately farmers will—if provided access, knowledge, finance and other risk-management tools-- adopt new varieties meeting their needs and increasing resilience to future climate and other shocks. The importance of farmer-based seed delivery systems, linked to quality input seed, is explicitly acknowledged and SeEdQUAL’s seed sector development must work for all,  ensuring a voice to farmers, especially women, at all stages of decision-making. \n \nLastly, seed-embedded technology, be it new traits, seed health or seed treatment, can and will be the “sharp-point of the spear” to deliver gains from One CGIAR breeding, agronomy and social science to farmers through our partners. These innovations, be they productivity, heat, drought tolerance, disease resistance or better nutrition will deliver on the One CGIAR reform agenda to improve livelihoods, nutrition, and resilience for smallholder farmers.",

Policy\noptions will lead to more sustainable, inclusive seed systems and market development, and\ncontributions across CGIAR Impact Areas.\n\nWP5 leverages the fact that target countries are pursuing seed sector policy reforms and have\narticulated a need for support in design and implementation. Likelihood for impact is increased\nif key conditions are fulfilled, including:\n• Early engagement with actors in conceptualization, design and implementation of WP5\nactivities.\n• Adequate resources aligned to actors’ needs and contributions to WP5’s activities and\nactions.\n• Shared objectives and mutual benefit among actors’ mandates and missions.\n• Coordination with MIPP for generation and communication of evidence from social and\neconomic sciences.\n• Recognition of CGIAR’s value proposition that strengthens actors’ capacity to achieve\noutcomes.\n• Opportunities to learn new methods of policy analysis and communication to advance\npartners’ own objectives.\n\nDemand partners: Ministries of agriculture charged with policy design and regulatory reforms;\npublic agencies charged with policy implementation in research, extension, and regulatory\nmatters; policy researchers, analysts, and advisors to government. Innovation partners:\nGlobal and regional organizations advancing seed policy reform agendas, e.g., AGRA, New\nMarket Lab (NML), SeedNL Partnership, and Integrated Seed Sector Development (ISSD)\nAfrica. Benchmarking initiatives including the Access to Seeds Index (ATSI), African Seed\n\nAccess Index (TASAI), and Enabling the Business of Agriculture (EBA). Scaling partners:\nnational governments and agricultural innovation system actors.\n\nWP5 links with WP1, WP2, and WP3 to identify policy opportunities for sustainable seed sector\ngrowth; WP4 on mechanisms to accelerate delivery of genetic gains to farmers; and with WP6\nand the CGIAR Gender Platform on transformative approaches prioritizing women, youth, and\ndisadvantaged groups. WP5 will engage MIPP on policy interventions to lower marketing risks,\nreduce constraints for seed enterprises and barriers to entry and will support RIIs on engagement with governmental, civil society, and private sector stakeholders.\n\nWP5 assumes policymakers represent society and that they are receptive to policy changes,\nwhich is not always the case. A risk for WP5 is failure of policymakers to consider policy reform options and take timely, evidence-driven decisions. Mitigation requires strong partnerships\nwith policy advisors, think tanks, and advocacy groups, combined with communications strategies, to integrate evidence-based recommendations in policy-change processes.\n\nWP5 supports innovation packages with policy guidance for inclusive seed sectors including options to accelerate adoption, turnover and increase demand for quality seed; transformative approaches supporting women, youth, and disadvantaged groups. These packages are\nintended to be at scale given that even small changes in policy can lead to large-scale impacts\nacross markets, agroecologies, and populations.\n\nPerformance will be measured against objectively verifiable outcomes specified in the results\nframework. \n",

The proposed work will generate urgently needed evidence on the state and key drivers of, and inequalities in, consumption of sustainable healthy diets and nutrition and health outcomes (output 1) and develop standardized indicators, tools, and metrics (output 2). Evidence will be used to stimulate interest among demand and innovation stakeholders to co-create and test scalable consumer and FE policies and innovations (output 3) and to implement the most promising and scalable ones in their country. By 2024, we expect that stakeholders initiate implementation of at least two innovations or policies to increase the demand for sustainable healthy diets in four target countries (EoI outcome 1), especially among women, youth, and other marginalized groups (EoI outcome 6).\n\nAchieving these outcome will depend on the following assumptions being met (or mitigation measures adopted): (1) that planned data collection is possible in all target countries (Section 7.3, risk 5); (2) that SHiFT will succeed in establishing trust and fruitful collaboration with relevant partners (Section 7.3, risk 1a); (3) that SHiFT effectively addresses gender, youth, and social inclusion (Section 7.3, risk 3); and (4) that SHiFT’s early and continued engagement with relevant stakeholders and efforts to strengthen their capacity facilitates learning and willingness to co-create and implement promising innovations and policies supported by adequate resources in their respective countries.\nWe will first work with demand partners (e.g., agriculture and health ministries, nutrition units, gender and social development units, consumer groups, civil society, etc.) and innovation partners (local research institutions, universities, data collection firms, local and international NGOs, UN institutions, and FE actors) to inform a comprehensive view of the nutrition and diet landscape and develop a policy research agenda. Local research partners and data collection firms along with international research and academic partners will actively participate in the research implementation stage to develop, adapt, and validate methods, tools, and metrics (e.g., IMMANA/LHSTM; INSP; INDDEX Project; Intake, etc.). The evidence generated will be disseminated, discussed, and understood by stakeholders (outcome within Initiative timeline (OWIT) 1). Key demand and innovation partners (including new partners such as GAIN, Rockefeller Foundation FS-TIP, USAID Food System Innovation Lab, etc.) will be willing to use the evidence generated by SHiFT to co-create scalable consumer and FE policies and innovations and to plan causal evaluations to assess impacts, pathways of impact, and cost effectiveness (OWIT 2) (Section 6.3 causal impact assessment). Impact evidence will be synthesized and disseminated among all our partners (demand, innovation, and scaling) who will understand this evidence and will be willing to use it to design and implement policies and innovations to achieve sustainable healthy diets for all (OWIT 3). If our assumptions are met and our OWITs achieved, we expect that by 2024, stakeholders will initiate implementation of innovations and policies to increase the demand for sustainable healthy diets in four target countries (EoI outcome 1) and that these innovations or policies will tackle gender and youth equality and social inclusion in food systems (EoI outcome 6).\nThe data, evidence, tools, metrics, and methods generated (outputs 1–3) will feed into SHiFT’s Food System Learning Center (Innovation 1); into WP2, helping FE actors deliver and promote sustainable nutritious foods; and into WP 3–5, using the evidence and learning when analyzing policies and trade-offs and developing context-specific transformative pathways. We will also collaborate on tools and metrics development and share research findings with other One CGIAR Initiatives that include a focus on consumers and sustainable healthy diets (e.g., FRESH; Resilient Cities; TAFSSA, Ukama Ustawi (U2)). We will promote the use of and encourage contributions to the Learning Center (Innovation 1) from these and other Initiatives that incorporate consumer demand considerations in their work.",

                "description": "Full Proposal ISDC Feedback",
                "narrative": "The overall purpose of the Initiative is to increase the contribution that CGIAR plant breeding makes to improving livelihoods, nutrition, and climate adaptation, while addressing equity and sustainability concerns. Building on Crops-to-End-Hunger (CtEH), the Initiative intends to transform CGIAR-NARES breeding to greatly increase the rate of genetic gain for key traits while significantly improving the benefit of new varieties to farmers and consumers, women, and marginalized groups, thereby contributing to driving down the age of varieties in farmers’ fields.\nThe Initiative works with MIPPI and SeEdQUAL to define a portfolio of prioritized product profiles that are informed by smallholder and market demands and, when adopted, have a high probability to create distinct and large-scale development impact. The Initiative empowers CGIAR-NARES-SME breeding teams to be more effective in implementing best-practice approaches to pursue the prioritized set of product profiles and develop climate-resilient, nutritious, market-demanded varieties. In collaboration with N4ETTS, it develops knowledge and skills among CGIAR, NARES and SME actors to: (i) execute effective, demand-focused trait discovery and deployment pipelines, (ii) more rapidly improve breeding populations through accelerated breeding cycles, and (iii) extract and identify farmer-and market-relevant varieties with higher accuracy, including through cross-referencing with farmers’ and scaling partners’ feedback, facilitated by SeEdQUAL. In addition, the Initiative will jointly review and revise organizational structures, partnership approaches, responsibilities, and decision-making processes to (i) increase ownership among all partners and research teams, (ii) capitalize on the specialized skills, human and operational capacity that exist across institutions, (iii) effectively utilize N4ETTS tools and services, and (iv) more readily attract and retain women professionals, young scientists, and innovation partners.\nThrough this approach, the Initiative intends to achieve the End-of-Initiative Outcomes as they are described in Section 2.2. and depicted in the Theory-of-Change Diagram (3.1.1), in CGIAR-NARES-SME breeding networks that work on staple crops and legumes with multi-country importance in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia where the greatest poverty and malnutrition occurs.\nThe Initiative will contribute to the following Action Area outcomes:\n1. CGIAR & partners use high-quality market intelligence to guide the development of new varieties to meet the needs and expectations of a wide-range of users, with special attention to marginalized groups.\n2. CGIAR & partner breeding programs use best practices and shared services to rapidly and efficiently produce new varieties with in-demand traits.\n3. Cooperation and co-investment by CGIAR, public- and private-sector seed-system actors supports coordinated and effective research and investment in the sector.\n4. Women and youth are empowered to be more active in decision making in food, land and water systems\nBy influencing these changes, and in collaboration with the other Genetic Innovation Initiatives, the Initiative will contribute to the following long-term outcomes (by 2030):\n1. CGIAR-NARES-SME breeding networks will be able to greatly increase genetic gains and develop varieties with traits that satisfy farmer and market demand.\n2. Seed-sector actors’ investments will be profitable and effective in scaling-up CGIAR and NARES varieties, driving down the age of varieties in farmers’ fields.\n3. Farmers will have wider access to, and use much improved climate-resilient, nutritious, market-demanded crop varieties.\n4. Public breeding investments are oriented to support varietal development with high potential for improving nutrition, poverty reduction, gender equity, climate adaptation or mitigation, environmental sustainability,\nBy contributing to these outcomes, the Initiative will support the achievement of SDG targets 1.1, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 5.5, 13.1.\nCrop varieties are highly scalable innovations, the development of will be more systematically informed by scientific evidence and expertise from national partners, seed system actors, farmers, consumers and value chain participants. Seed system actors and national partners, crucial for scaling, will become active drivers of the innovation process and, facilitated by SeEdQUAL, more successful in implementing adaptive scaling strategies for forthcoming crop varieties.\nThe following key assumptions underpin the theory of change\n• Seed system actors will experience an increasingly conducive policy environment.\n• Farmers will be able to increase incomes from market-demanded varieties.\n• Market, household, seed sector and impact studies help to incrementally improve the focus of breeding pipelines, to serve feasible impact pathways that create large scale benefits.",

                "work_package_toc": "The purpose of ReFOCUS is to achieve greater focus of CGIAR breeding by working with MIPP to better define product profiles aligned to distinct market segments and target environments; and rationalize and align CGIAR breeding pipeline structures and investments – individually and combined as a portfolio --for greatest and most probable contributions to the five CGIAR impact goals.\nThe demand for greater focus and clearer prioritization comes from funders and national governments investing public or philanthropic funds into breeding, and from research leaders, breeders and seed companies wanting to invest scarce resources to achieve maximum impact. The CGIAR currently has a portfolio including over 135 product profiles across 24 crops. Breeding pipelines pursue traits related to greater productivity, resilience (to pests and diseases, weather variability and climate change), biofortification (for pro-vitamin A, zinc and iron), reduced greenhouse gas emission, labor-saving or distinct end uses.\nWorking closely with MIPP and drawing N4ETTS tools and services, ReFOCUS will (i) assess realistic breeding ambitions and associated investments to help define the portfolio of achievable product profiles that the CGIAR-NARES-SME breeding teams commit to develop within a certain time frame, (ii) structure breeding pipelines so that each are aligned with a defined product profile(s), market segment and targeted impact(s).\nThe key 2024 Outcome - CGIAR-NARES breeding pipelines oriented towards specific market segments, enabling greater focus on farmers’ needs, drivers of adoption, and impact - is anticipated to be achieved through four interlinked pathways:\nA. Orientation towards greater adoption: By CGIAR and NARES breeders working with social scientists (MIPP) and the seed sector (SeEdQUAL) in revising product profiles aligned to market demands, impact opportunities and drivers of adoption, product profiles will become the driving force for all breeding decisions within CGIAR-NARES-SME breeding networks. They determine the traits evaluated and used at each stage of selection, and the relative emphasis given between traits, leading to varieties that will more likely be adopted.\nB. Systematizing client-led validation: By linking in with SeEdQUAL for client-feedback during on-farm trialing and scale-out, product profiles can be purposefully adjusted and selection emphases shifted. Client-led validation will become a systematized component of the breeding process, and help to evolve the portfolio of targeted product profiles.\nC. Transparency driving breeding investments: By linking breeding investments and distinct target markets to most likely development impacts on MIPP’s Investor Dashboard, transparency is being created that will allow investors, national governments, and implementers to confidently allocate resources to distinct pipeline investment cases.\nD. A system change for targeting: By NARES and SMEs actively participating in the product profile definition, knowledge for defining and prioritizing product profiles will flow to the NARES and SMEs; they will increase the adoption of these concepts in their own breeding programs.\nReFOCUS will co-develop Innovation Packages for all four Pathways with MIPP’s Institutional Innovation and G×I Learning Alliance (also including PHRRFLS and SeEdQUAL) (2 core innovations).",

                "narrative": "Our five WPs collectively aim to achieve 11 End-of-Initiative outcomes, contributing to five Action Area outcomes and nine SDGs, addressing three challenge areas identified as key bottlenecks in agri-food systems transformation.\n1.\tThe digital divide: To support policy makers’ efforts to reduce the digital division that hampers equitable access to technology and information in rural areas, WP1 will generate evidence of the impacts of digital infrastructure and develop enabling policies, plans, and strategies that can collectively strengthen local digital innovation ecosystems. We assume policymakers and investors will use these outputs to create strong investment cases toward rural digital infrastructure, digital ecosystems, and information systems for the poor, about the poor. WP2 will particularly contribute to digital inclusion for women and youths. Digital innovation developers will be supported to use bundles of data, services, and gender-responsive design guidance and measurement tools to scale their services to reach 100% more users, including >40% women and >40% youth.\n2.\tInadequate information: To support diverse stakeholders across food-water-land systems in accessing timely, reliable, and actionable information, WP3 will codevelop real-time monitoring, integrated modeling, and enhanced early warning systems for natural resource management (NRM) and research organizations to manage climate risks in agrifood systems. Through the provision of data and decision-support tools, we assume transboundary stakeholders will better coordinate the planning and allocation of shared land and water resources. WP4 will contribute to the generation and frictionless flow of key information and codevelop use cases demonstrating the power of real-time data and advanced analytics, such as the digitization and traceability of food and farm inputs, for >1,000 food-system actors to make informed decisions towards reducing food waste, improving food quality, choosing healthy food, and stabilizing prices.\n3.\tLimited digital capabilities: To build the digital capabilities of agrifood system actors, WP5 will support >10 research and development organizations, including other Initiatives, to fill data and knowledge gaps, establish South x South triangular cooperation, and develop pilot solutions that promote sustainability across food-water-land systems. We assume partnering organizations and practitioners will improve institutional digital capabilities to utilize real-time data in making informed risk-management decisions. Targeted digital literacy and skills training will be co-organized with local digital extension partners for small-scale producers and other food systems stakeholders. Evidence of impacts will be generated by conducting impact analyses in rural communities whose livelihoods depend on food-water-land systems’ sustainability. \nBuilding on CGIAR’s expertise in designing innovations, generating impact evidence, and providing research-based policy solutions, DX1 is envisioned as a trusted digital research-for-development partner supporting public and private information and innovation systems. Initiative scientists possess both domain knowledge and advanced technological skills to succeed in this role. We assume that prior work with key stakeholders across all focus countries will help to further develop fruitful partnerships, achieving the desired outcomes. Also, we assume that co-designing with end-users through user-centric strategies will allow services, data, and evidence meet identified needs, resulting in organic scaling and sustainable models. While each WP will conduct demand-driven research in specific focus geographies, their outputs and approaches will be developed as a global public good delivered for RIIs to scale across their respective regions. More details on synergies, agreed collaboration and potential added value with other Initiatives can be found in the Initiative full proposal.",

FRESH will start with research on consumers to understand dietary patterns and drivers of low levels of F&V intake and identify opportunities for shifting dietary behaviors (WP1). Simultaneously we will work with farmers and other value chain actors to understand production (WP2 & WP3) and post-harvest possibilities (WP4) for affordable, safe and sustainable produce and associated products. Food environments will also be assessed and opportunities for increasing accessibility and affordability of F&V identified (WP5). By approaching the problem of low F&V intake in this way, FRESH aims to create a systemwide win-win approach within the F&V sector in which consumers’, farmers’ and other value chain actors’ diet, nutrition, health and livelihood aspirations are met, and more resilient and equitable F&V value chains are created. \n\nFRESH will achieve these goals through its’ six interconnected WPs whose activities will be based on an iterative and multilayered co-creation process. This process will bring together a wide range of stakeholders from government, multilateral organizations, NGOs, CSOs, farmers’, women’s and youth groups, academia, the private sector and other CGIAR Initiatives. Building on the country stakeholder meetings (section 2.6) we will develop a F&V Stakeholder Group and hold biannual meetings within the four focus countries. The meetings will be used to inform FRESH’s overall direction and to ensure alignment with national priorities, contextual and cultural factors. From the F&V Stakeholder group, each WP will identify a subset of partners with whom to form sub-committees (which may include people external to the F&V Stakeholder Group, as relevant) to participate in each WP’s co-design processes. These committees will meet regularly to identify, design and test innovations across the value chain to address desirability, accessibility, affordability and availability barriers to F&V intake. These subcommittees will provide updates on progress, discuss emerging evidence and constraints or opportunities in the co-design, piloting and scaling processes at the biannual F&V Stakeholder Meetings. We expect that this iterative and multi-layered co-design process will contribute to increasing stakeholder awareness of identified constraints and opportunities and give participant’s voice and agency for effecting and directing change across the F&V sector.  \n\nThe activities undertaken by FRESH’s six interconnected WPs are expected to lead to: scaling partners integrating effective behavioral approaches for increasing F&V intake into their programs (EoI outcome 2), farmers’ adopting improved cultivars (EoI Outcome 3), farmers’ adopting technologies to improve production efficiency (EoI Outcome 4), value chain actors adopting technologies to reduce post-harvest losses and improve food safety (EoI Outcome 5), scaling partners designing and testing interventions to increase F&V accessibility and affordability (EoI Outcome 6) and scaling partners prioritizing F&Vs and ensuring specific actions to increase F&V production, processing, and intake are integrated into national policies, laws and regulations (EoI Outcome 7). To reduce fragmentation of F&V R&D and facilitate global learning, FRESH will create a F&V Knowledge Hub to serve as a platform for housing and sharing F&V research and innovation accessible to all (EoI Outcome 1). Together these outcomes are expected to contribute to a range of action area outcomes and in turn, achievement of goals across the five impact areas.\n\n",

                "work_package_toc": "To make progress in increasing F&V intake convenience and desirability issues must be addressed. Context- and population-specific dietary patterns and their drivers need to be characterized and cost-effective behavioral approaches identified and integrated into large-scale programs and embedded into policies. Globally there is an enabling environment to support these efforts. For example, the Healthy Diets Coalition has recently formed and will emphasize three priority areas including, “valuing food: motivating individuals, families and communities to eat healthy diets through multi-dimensional education, information, demand generation and behavior change support”. In preparation for the UNFSS, Sri Lanka, Tanzania and the Philippines highlighted the need for behavioral approaches to address their countries’ nutrition problems suggesting demand for innovative behavioral approaches and an enabling environment for uptake of evidence-based approaches (assumption 1). \nBuilding on this momentum we will use a co-design process based on a 5-step process used successfully by IFPRI and WFP to improve effectiveness of nutrition-sensitive programs at WFP with multi-stakeholder groups in Benin, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Tanzania. These groups will include representatives from other FRESH WPs and our External Advisory Panel and will build from the group of stakeholders who participated in the country stakeholder consultations (Section 2.6). \nBiannual meetings (output 4) will serve as a platform for discussing national priorities and policies, local programs, and contextual factors along with emerging evidence related to F&V, diets, effectiveness of behavioral approaches, and assessment tools, some of which will be generated under SHiFT, Resilient Cities TAFSSA and Her+. The first group task will be selecting priority life-cycle groups (and sub-groups (e.g. urban/rural, SES status)) for the dietary assessments. These will be co-implemented and analyzed with our academic partners like Wayamba University in Sri Lanka (output 1) and will contribute to the country-specific F&V profiles (output 2) and menu of options (output 3). We expect that sharing these outputs will lead to improved understanding by participating agencies of context- and population-specific dietary patterns, barriers to F&V intake, and options for addressing those barriers (outcome 1). This will inform and guide scaling partners, like WFP, to identify opportunities and be willing to implement them along with rigorous impact evaluations (outcome 2). It will also inform and guide local government investments in the implementation and testing of behavioral approaches (outcome 3). Lastly, we expect our academic partners to be interested and willing to collaborate on related impact evaluations (outcome 4). \nBased on the identified opportunities (e.g. in Sri Lanka using FRANI to nudge adolescents to improve diets with or without peer-to-peer learning), a subset of stakeholders (e.g. WFP, Ministry of Education, Foundation for Health Promotion, FRESH WP5) will collaborate to design pilot plans (output 5). If funding, timing and capacity allow (assumption 3), we expect partners like WFP or the Ministry of Education to co-design behavioral approaches and integrate these into their programs (e.g. national awareness campaigns or SAPs) and co-implement comprehensive impact evaluations with FRESH scientists in the four focus countries (EoI outcome 1). These activities, including analysis, will start in year 2 (output 6) and extend to phase 2 to allow sufficient time to impact diets, health, and nutrition outcomes. We will create longitudinal cohorts within the impact evaluations as funding allows to assess long-term impacts. Evaluation results will be disseminated through multiple channels to help guide future investments. \n",

The growing demand for food will make the current production losses intolerable  with pressures on food security further compounded by predicted climate induced productivity decline   . Conventional breeding has made significant advancements, demonstrating impressive levels of impact from genetic solutions for smallholders in developing countries . Nevertheless, conventional breeding alone will not generate the step-change in yields required to meet future demand for high quality, nutritious food. A major technical drawback of conventional breeding is the inability to precisely select traits without including undesirable ‘co-segregating’ traits from donor lines (genetic linkage drag). Efforts to remove undesirable traits are never fully successful and require additional breeding cycles, prolonging the process, adding costs, and delaying benefit realization. \nGenome editing (GEd) is a cost- and time-effective solution that can strategically complement conventional breeding . GEd enables precise and predictable refinement of crop genomes   . GEd can be done in elite breeding lines and commercial varieties, enabling quick and cheap delivery of essential traits to users . GEd is being used in more than 40 crops across 25 countries, with six GEd crop varieties (soybean, canola, rice, maize, mushroom and camelina) approved for commercialization .\nDespite the significant step-change in impact achievable through GEd and recent positive regulatory trends in many countries (including Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, Kenya, Nigeria, India, and the Philippines), debate and regulatory developments are ongoing. However, the discussion has shifted to a need for a sensible and pragmatic appreciation of benefits and risks, with a call to balance caution and innovation, recognizing that “governance must cope with a moving technical frontier” . Statements from the G20 Agricultural Scientists (2021) and the European Commission (2021) affirmed the potential for New Genomic Techniques (NGT) to make valuable contributions to food security and environmental sustainability, concluding that “any further policy action should be aimed at reaping benefits from innovation while addressing concerns” . Generally, within-species genetic changes using GEd are more readily accepted than transgenic innovations.\nThe Genome Editing Initiative (GEdI) takes a holistic and long-term view of growing future demand for GEd solutions as experience with the technology and social acceptance grows. Complementary innovations to support high standards of product stewardship, guide intellectual property management, facilitate licensing, encourage enabling societal and policy environments, and support delivery of GEd products to market have been included in Work Package 1 (WP1). Capacity building across NARS, SMEs and ARIs, collaborating partners in Work Package 2 (WP2), is designed to position these networks to use GEd more efficiently, effectively, and responsibly while building local innovation understanding and acceptance across socio-political landscapes. This will contextualize and promote equitable access and research spillovers, generating significant future benefits and minimizing future technological disadvantages   . Work Package (WP3) has identified exogenous DNA-free GEd innovations with potential for transformative scales of impact that are in demand by partners who are enthusiastic for GEd enabled benefits (Annex 1 and Annex 2). As one prominent government official said at the planning consultation for this Initiative, “it will be important to harness the power of precision genetics, mainly genome editing, to deliver products that reduce hunger and poverty, and address actual needs of humanity” (Annex 3).\n",
                "narrative": "GEdI aims “to deliver genetic solutions that are difficult to achieve with conventional breeding technologies, generating a step-change in the targeted Impact Areas”, i.e. SDGs (1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 12, 13). Impact will only occur when GEd innovations and the enabling social and governance policies and systems are in place, supporting varieties developed from GEd breeding lines to progress to market and use. Work Packages 1 and 2 will foster enabling environments, while Work Package 3 will develop GEd innovations.\nWP1 will establish a Research Enabling and Oversight (REO) Unit to provide strategic leadership on the current and future use of GEd, spanning the product lifecycle. The REO Unit will monitor global needs, maintain consultation with diverse stakeholders including regulators and seed systems, and undertake impact projections to inform rigorous Eschborn-aligned prioritization. WP1 will work alongside Market Intelligence and Accelerated Breeding to identify GEd opportunities that complement GI’s portfolio of conventional breeding. WP1 will establish a framework for successful GEd investment that can accommodate future GEd opportunities. These activities will achieve the EIO ‘CGIAR, NARS and SMEs use a strategic approach for scaling GEd innovations, including frameworks to mitigate risks and harness opportunities’, and contribute to the GI outcomes ‘CGIAR & partners use high quality market intelligence to guide the development of new varieties to meet the needs and expectations of a wide range of users, with special attention to marginalized groups’ and ‘cooperation & co-investment by CGIAR, public- and private-sector seed-system actors supports coordinated & effective research and investment in the sector’. \nWP2 will form expert-supported, gender and age diverse, cross organization Communities of Practice (COP) covering technical, social and policy aspects of the GEd product cycle. Learning and experience will be shared to co-develop best practice guidelines and supporting resources, building capacity of CGIAR’s partnered breeding network and achieving the EIO ‘NARS, end-users and policymakers are supported in using GEd as an option to address agricultural development constraints & opportunities’, and contributing to the GI outcome ‘CGIAR & partner breeding programs use state-of-the-art technologies to accelerate variety development and quality’.\nWP3 will progress identified priorities, to achieve both EIOs ‘NARS, ARIs and SMEs co-develop and jointly use GEd lines in breeding programs to efficiently achieve step-change gains for demand driven traits’ and 'NARS, ARIs, SMEs and decision-makers use GEd technology to incorporate the needs of women and youth in market-demanded products within agrifood systems’, significantly contributing to the GI outcome ‘Farmers have access to and use climate-resilient, nutritious, market-demanded crop varieties.’\nGEdI’s logic assumes that:\n•\tTechnical and non-technical innovations are needed to progress GEd innovations to market.\n•\tGEdI priorities will complement conventional breeding priorities, forming a unified portfolio.\n•\tThere are sufficient demand partners for GEd innovations, and they will be more effective if supported to develop and implement strategies to progress GEd innovations to market.\n•\tPartnering organizations will collaborate on common challenges to co-develop tools and resources for broader use.\n•\tGEd breeding lines will be accepted into conventional breeding programs.\n•\tIncreased pest and disease resistance will increase crop yields, improving food security and nutrition and reducing poverty. \n•\tIncreased pest and disease resistance will support better IPM with improvements for environmental health and biodiversity.\n•\tImproved translocation of nitrogen will reduce the need for fertilizers and other trait improvements, reducing methane greenhouse gas emissions.\n",

Validation of performance, and use of these GEd breeding lines in field trials will require prior assurance of freedom from exogenous DNA, and approval from regulatory authorities. To support this, WP3 will develop and use Excellence in Stewardship protocols, a traceability methodology developed, operating procedures to ensure exogenous DNA-free status is maintained and quality assurance processes to give certifiers confidence in the products (2). Within the three years of this Initiative, WP3 will submit at least two products for decision by regulatory authorities about their regulatory status, expecting they will not be subject to GM (transgenic) regulatory requirements (3). \nBy working in CoPs assembled and enabled in WP2, and on GEd products that have been identified through consultation, there will be high levels of co-ownership, user readiness for the products, and enthusiasm to include GEd lines in breeding pipelines and elite varieties (4).  \nThe use of GEd technology to directly edit advanced breeding lines or farmer popular varieties will increase the speed that demand-driven traits can be incorporated into varieties (5). As a result, GEd products will be used to achieve step-change in the targeting Impact Areas and to incorporate the needs of women and youth in market demanded varieties (6, 7).\n",

                "narrative": "EiA builds on progress made through the EiA Planning [EiA_Planning_Phase_reports] and Incubation Phase (2020-2022) [EiA_Incubation_Phase_progress_report_2020]. EiA’s WP structure is based on a set of interlinked functions that guide the development and delivery of agronomy-at-scale solutions rather than on specific research themes. After all, EiA’s portfolio is driven by demand from private and public scaling partners who actively engage with large numbers of farmers rather than by a “supply-driven”, thematic research agenda (Section 2.4). The Modules of the EiA Planning Phase were thus used as the basis for formulating the WPs [EiA_Modules_turned_Work_packages] while Communities of Practice (CoPs) organized around EiA’s priority research themes will guide a thematically balanced research portfolio.\nThe ORGANIZE WP prioritizes target areas and systems, promotes EiA as a primary resource for agronomy R&D, identifies opportunities for EiA to focus its research, leads the ex-ante impact assessments of these opportunities, and assesses progress against the agronomic gain KPIs. Opportunities for impact at scale are moved to the DELIVER WP that operationalizes Use Cases for the development and delivery of bespoke agronomic solutions.\nAll Use Cases utilize a generic 7-step workflow to design, validate, and pilot solutions, building strongly on data, analytics, and decision support logic from the TRANSFORM WP [EiA_Use_Cases_Generic_Workflow]. TRANSFORM also turns piloted solutions into turnkey solutions for other interested partners. This WP hosts capacity development activities to facilitate use of TRANSFORM products by NARES and other public and private science partners. This WP hosts capacity development activities to ensure access to TRANSFORM products by NARS and other public and private science partners. When key data or tools are lacking, the INNOVATE WP sets up strategic R&D projects to address such gaps. INNOVATE also supports R&D for other EiA functions (e.g., agronomic gain assessment) and engages with high-risk but potentially high-return R&D, in partnership with ARIs. Communities of Practices will grow into a critical mass of stakeholders working on and benefitting from EiA’s priority research themes (see Section 2.4). While TRANSFORM and INNOVATE host most of the functions of EiA Global, DELIVER will be core to the EiA Regional Programs and ORGANZE will facilitate interactions between both EiA dimensions.\nThe end-of-Initiative outcomes reflect the dimensions required for an efficient and effective agronomy-at-scale Initiative, including (i) Inclusive partnerships aligned along gender- and youth-responsive agronomic solutions, supported by effective decision-making and MELIA tools (end-of-Initiative outcome 1); (ii) Standardized, open, and FAIR data and analytics, supported by effective data governance (end-of-Initiative outcome 2); (iii) State-of-the-art science with direct engagement of ARIs and empowered NARS (end-of-Initiative outcome 3); and (iv) Objective decision-making on which agronomy R&D to implement where, with whom, and why, based on systematic demand mapping (end-of-Initiative outcome 4).\nThese outcomes contribute to the delivery of the Resilient Agrifood Systems outcomes and the five CGIAR Impact Areas, as detailed in section 2.7, and to a diverse set of Sustainable Development Goals. Assumptions underlying contributions to the RAFS outcomes are integrated in the various WP TOCs, as detailed below. EiA is engaging with a number of other Initiatives [EiA_Interactions_with_other_Initiatives_2021] and discussions with these and other Initiatives will be finalized before the end of 2021.",

Use Cases will from a pipeline of projects of 3-4 years, informed by stage-gate decisions on progress made against the delivery of the agronomy-at-scale solutions. Handing over solutions to demand partners will thus free up time for the EiA teams to engage in new Use Cases formulated around new agronomic challenges.\nUse Cases will be aligned to EiA priority research themes: (1) Sustaining soil health and crop productivity and ecosystem services, focusing on site-specific nutrient management, organic matter recycling, and agronomic fortification; (2) Climate change adaptation, focusing on time of planting management, micro-irrigation and water harvesting, risk reduction, and system re-design; (3) Precision cropping system management solutions, focusing on diversification, mechanization, and weed control; and (4) Perennials for livelihoods and conservation, focusing on tree-based systems, greenhouse gas balances, and linking intensification to conservation. EiA’s Incubation Phase already has 10 active Use Cases [EiA_Use_Case_descriptions_2021] and an additional set of at least 10 Use Cases will be activated during the 1st business cycle [EiA_New_Use_Cases_2021].\nEach Use Case is assessed for scaling readiness to ensure that Core Innovations are accompanied with associated complementary innovations and inclusive partnerships. The identification of MVPs will be informed by yield gap analyses and farmer segmentation, and all MVPs will be climate-smart and gender- and youth-responsive. Assumptions underlying the identification and delivery of gender- and youth-responsive agronomic solutions are related to the effectiveness of the Use Case model, the appropriateness of solutions in terms of visible and reliable benefits and the willingness of scaling partners to engage in co-creation processes. Specific MELIA studies are planned to address these assumptions (Section 6.3). One-stop-shops will promote EiA solutions to interested parties through, amongst others, advocacy and engagement in agricultural events. The main partners will be public and private partners leading agricultural development Initiatives with agronomy as a key component. A major assumption is continued investments in agronomic solutions.\nThe DELIVER WP will utilize the prioritization of cropping systems and geographic regions by the ORGANIZE WP (Outputs 4.2 and 4.5). Furthermore, the TRANSFORM WP Outputs 2.2 and 2.4 will be utilized in the formulation and deployment of MVPs within Use Cases. Outputs related to capacity development from the TRANSFORM WP will enable the implementation of gender-transformative strategies by Use Cases. The DELIVER WP will rely on Outputs of other CGIAR Initiatives, namely the Digital Technologies, the HER+, and Plant Health, noting that discussions are on-going with others [EiA_Interactions_Other_Initiatives_2021].",

Successful varietal replacement and product substitution will also require behavioral intelligence on how to influence farmers and consumers to start purchasing new products, and how to steer government, private sector and NGOs towards promoting new products and varieties through approaches such as awareness creation, choice engineering, nudging, and relaxing other demand-side constraints to adoption. WP3 therefore aims to unravel constraints to varietal uptake by generating behavioral intelligence on gender equitable and socially inclusive approaches to accelerate turnover and promote new products.\n\nGenerating such behavioral intelligence will be informed by existing evidence on agricultural technology adoption, ongoing adoption studies within CGIAR and partners, and private sector market intelligence. Field experiments resulting in behavioral Intelligence Briefs and peer reviewed research articles will generate insights on how to accelerate variety replacement by farmers and product substitution by consumers, whilst ensuring inclusion and gender equity. These insights will inform Regional, transdisciplinary CGIAR-NARES-SME teams, and help resource-constrained NARES develop capacity and attract resources to accelerate varietal turnover in a more cost-effective and inclusive manner (EoI Outcome 1). \n\nCase studies and experiments co-implemented with governments, private sector and NGOs will provide insights on cost-effectiveness, inclusivity, profitability and barriers that prevent these actors from promoting new products. The behavioral intelligence generated through WP3 on how to accelerate turnover and promote new products, along with tools allowing stakeholders to generate such intelligence for their own settings, will be shared with other Initiatives (SeEdQUAL, SHiFT and FRESH) to scale demonstrated approaches (EoI Outcome 3) and ultimately enhance impacts of investments in genetic innovation. \n\nWhereas WP1 and WP2 provide WP4 with the market intelligence and product profiles required for impactful breeding, WP3 will generate behavioral intelligence on what else — beyond traits — drives varietal turnover, and what strategies are needed for customers to adopt the proposed product profiles. This will inform pipeline investment (WP4) on how much it will cost to reach the desired level of varietal/product replacement/substitution in each product market segment for a targeted product profile, which is important in cost-benefit analyses of investment scenarios. Behavioral insights on varietal turnover in WP3 also inform impact assessment and capacity building in WP5; and WP3 experiments provide a structure for (quasi)-experimental ex-post impact evaluation (WP5). \n\nAt the end of the Initiative, behavioral intelligence generated through WP3 will inform the Regional, transdisciplinary CGIAR-NARES-SME teams and at least two other Initiatives on how to accelerate varietal turnover in a more cost-effective and inclusive manner, and at least three government, private sector or NGO actors will use behavioral intelligence from WP3 in their decision to change their approaches for promoting new varieties and products. Beyond the timeframe of the Initiative, this will result in increased variety replacement and product substitution by women and men farmers and consumers, increased profitability of private sector actors, improvements in the five CGIAR Impact Areas, and strengthened impacts of CGIAR breeding activities.\n",

                "narrative": "Our theory of change is that in order for AFS actors—including CGIAR, national governments \nand non-CGIAR AR4D partners—to succeed in significantly boosting the resilience of women and \nempower women as partners and drivers of CC solutions, we must:\n(a) Adopt a socioecological system framework32 approach—i.e., intervene at key leverage \npoints in the multiple systems (social, economic, technological and governance) that feed into \nCC resilience and result in transformation and empowerment.\n(b) Ensure AFS actors are equipped with the tools, methods and evidence required to \noptimize programs for increased access to, and adoption of, CC resilience measures and \ntechnologies by women. \nHER+ outcome planning takes a stepwise approach, sequenced by (i) End-of-Initiative \noutcomes to be achieved in the 2022–2024 cycle (see section 2.2), followed by (ii) longer term \noutcomes expected by 2030 (outlined briefly in the WP TOCs), spanning the causal leap between \nEnd of Initiative (EoI) Outcomes and the System Transformation Action Area outcome. The logic \nis that understanding is followed by doing—we will answer the 2022–2024 questions so that we \ncan take the 2024–2030 actions.\nThe theory is that EoI Outcomes can be achieved if HER+ takes concerted action at entry points \nmapped along the four dimensions of inequality identified for the UNFSS33 around AFS drivers \nand gendered shocks (see Figure 1) that must be addressed for gender equity to be achieved. \nThese actions are centered on: \n● Gendered social norms (addressed by WP1—TRANSFORM: Gender transformative \napproaches): HER+ will identify leverage points and levers to address normative \nconstraints work with Initiatives (ClimBeR, LCSR, EiA) and downstream partners to test \nGTAs at multiple scales to increase women’s resilience.\n● Women’s agency (addressed by WP2—EMPOWER: Bundled innovations for \nwomen’s empowerment): HER+ will identify and test diverse configurations for CGIAR \nand non-CGIAR STIB design to increase women’s resilience and empowerment more \neffectively. \n● Access to and control over resources (addressed by WP3—PROTECT: Gender\u0002responsive social protection): HER+ will work with governments and development \nNGOs to test how adjustments to social protection and complementary programs can \nstrengthen women’s resilience and reduce inequality.\n● Policies and Governance (addressed by WP4—VOICE: Inclusive governance and \npolicies): HER+ will work with partners to deploy social innovations, organizational \nstrategies, and public and private-sector policies that increase the voice and agency of \nwomen in climate-relevant AFS governance and build their resilience to CC. \nHER+ efforts to mainstream gender-equitable climate resilience into AFS in five countries (2022–\n2024), and scaling efforts through downstream AR4D partnerships (2024–2030), are expected to \nprovide 8.5 million women with increased resilience to CC by 2030.\nThis TOC is underpinned by assumptions that (A1) evidence on the effectiveness of GTAs to \novercome normative constraints creates an evidence base for AFS stakeholders to use GTAs, \n(A2) private and public stakeholders are used research from WP2 to adapt STIBs to boost uptake, \n(A3) governments and large INGOs are adjusting social protection programs to improve women’s \n",

            "work_package_toc": "Investment in CGIAR breeding pipelines has been supply-driven due to a lack of evidence on pipelines’ returns on investment beyond productivity and food security. There is a need to demonstrate the impact of CGIAR pipeline investments on food security, poverty, gender equality, opportunities for youth, social inclusion, climate adaptation and mitigation and reduction of environmental footprint. EiB assembled the first round of pipeline investment cases covering 119 pipelines for 25 crops and 428 product market segments identified at the CGIAR region level. This effort identified the need to review the alignment of pipelines to product market segments, revise pipeline investment cases and understand the range of investment in pipelines. A tiered approach to explain and manage differences in the activity focused on each product market segment should be implemented. Standardizing increments of capacity and defining deliverables for each pipeline would be a huge step forward. The process to prioritize pipelines and to recommend investment in a pipeline must be inclusive, transparent, and equitable. Assessing the opportunity/impact of a pipeline requires expertise from social scientists, impact assessment economists, gender specialists, breeders, food scientists and nutritionists. WP1 will identify product market segments and Accelerated Breeding Initiative’s WP1 will provide information on the alignment of pipelines to product market segments and the investment in each pipeline. Using this information, combined with gender-intentional product profiles developed in WP2 and their marketability assessed in WP3, WP4 describes the opportunity/impact for each pipeline and calculates metrics on the ratio of investment to opportunity/impact for each pipeline. Using these metrics, WP4 will generate pipeline investment cases, develop recommendations for pipeline prioritization, recommend pipeline investment levels and publish this information to the Investor Dashboard, an innovation that will be co-developed with Digital Transformation and Breeding Resources and be monitored through an Innovation Package and Scaling Readiness Plan (Section 4). Strong engagement with end-users and clear visualization of returns on investment encourages research leaders and investors to use the Investor Dashboard in investment and resource allocation decision making and adjust their portfolios, motivated by a strong drive to increase returns on their investments. To achieve these outcomes, a research effort on pipeline investment will be initiated and focus on advanced investment and cost analysis of breeding pipelines and supporting investment prioritization and optimization (see table). This research will generate databases, investment briefs, peer-reviewed research articles, case study briefs, blogs and workshops. \n\nThe increased transparency on the impacts generated by genetic innovation and increased accountability and need to demonstrate impacts will encourage CGIAR-NARES-SME regional breeding networks to implement breeding pipelines for prioritized crops with a more focused structure and alignment to the five Impact Areas. These outcomes will contribute to AA Outcomes 2, 5, 7 and 8. Achieving these outcomes will require that the data collected in WP1, WP2 and WP3 are of sufficient quality and detail that they enable building credible pipeline investment cases that convince investors to maintain or increase their investments in genetic innovation.\n",

                "narrative": "The research and development community increasingly recognize the interconnections between\nfood, land, and water (FLW) systems, and the importance of jointly managing systems\ntransformation under climate change and uncertainty to achieve more sustainable, equitable, and\nresilient development. However, research and our experience also highlight the persistent\ntechnical and institutional barriers to adopting a multi-systems approach, with many analytical\nadvances taking place within specific areas (e.g., agriculture and climate change), but without\ncommensurate progress in combining tools and analysis across FLW systems to address a\nbroader set of interlinked challenges. This is despite growing demand from governments and\ndevelopment partners for cross-cutting analysis to understand trends, anticipate trade-offs, and\nidentify priorities. Moreover, FLW systems are expected to contribute to an expanding set of\ngoals, requiring new tools and metrics to track more outcomes and trade-offs. As the required\nforesight tools and metrics become more numerous and complex, researchers and government\nagencies in many developing countries find it difficult to contribute to and use foresight analysis\nto inform the policy and investment choices they face.\nThe Foresight and Metrics Initiative identifies four elements of this gap:\n1. Given that food, land, and water systems are interconnected not only in terms of outcomes\nand trade-offs but also between countries and regions, a clear picture is needed of the\nlarger global and regional landscape within which policymakers in developing countries\nconfront their particular challenges. To date, this larger picture lacks sufficient resolution\non the needs of developing countries.\n2. Within that larger context, national policymakers often face analytical and institutional\nbarriers to evaluating complex links and trade-offs between policy options and outcomes\nof interest to them.\n3. National policymakers and their development partners often lack access to state-of-theart foresight tools and metrics that can inform the decisions they make. Foresight tools are\nin high demand already and improved access will enhance their uptake and use.\n4. Even when state-of-the-art tools are available, national policymakers, particularly in lowincome countries, often lack the capacity to use and adapt them to address their needs.\nThe four Work Packages of the Foresight and Metrics Initiative are designed to help national\ngovernments and their development partners overcome these gaps. The four Work Packages\ntogether build on close and on-going engagement and learning with partners who are directly\ninvolved in supporting policy makers – not only to strengthen capacity, provide access to tools,\nenhance learning, and collaborate in joint research and policy dialogue, but to co-design the\napplication of foresight tools to address the expressed needs and questions of partners and to\nbuild trust and confidence in the results generated (",

As such, understanding the demand for our innovations and\nunpacking the enabling environment to identify the key actors along our impact pathway are\nembedded into the Work Package from the beginning (see section 4 for more information).\nCountry launch events will be held to formally convene groups, discuss approaches, and outline\nobjectives. TWGs will receive ongoing training (WP4) and will progressively develop CIAMs using\nlocal tools and data where appropriate (Output 2). TWGs will conduct initial diagnostic studies of\nFWL systems’ main drivers and climate risks, and with PAGs, shortlist policy/investment options\nfor in-depth analysis (Output 1). TWGs will use CIAMs to analyze climate and development\nscenarios and policies/investments, with results presented/updated at annual PAG-TWG\nmeetings. Annual progress reports will summarize the analysis, and a final synthesis report\n(Output 3) will be presented at in-country closing events. Where possible, outputs will be\nsequenced and aligned with national policy cycles (e.g., national development and adaptation\nplans), but WP2 will also provide the tools and evidence to inform ongoing decision-making. Tools\nand scenario results (Output 4) will be made publicly available via the Foresight Portal (WP3).\nEnd-of-Initiative outcomes:\n1. Research partners in focus countries contribute to developing CIAM and use it to analyze\nmegatrends and climate risks affecting FLW systems transformation, and to provide\nactionable recommendations that minimize trade-offs and maximize synergies across\ncompeting goals.\n2. Government partners in focus countries use foresight analysis of FLW system drivers,\nincluding climate risks, to inform policy debates and enhance decision-making, leading to\npolicies/investments, such as national development and adaptation plans, that encourage\nFLW systems transformations that are more resilient, sustainable, and inclusive.\nWP2 aims to inform decision-making in focus countries by combining advanced foresight analysis\n(conducted jointly by CGIAR and local researchers), with a more deliberate, intensive, and\nsustained engagement with multiple government ministries. Governments in focus countries have\narticulated demand for foresight/modeling, but the timing of WP2’s analysis may not perfectly\nalign with local policy cycles, especially for all ministries involved. This could reduce WP2’s direct\npolicy influence and impact. Moreover, local researchers with suitable expertise and foresight\nexperience may not exist, especially within all areas of FLW systems. To reduce these risks, WP2\nwill co-create workplans with TWGs and PAGs to improve alignment; ensure that the foresight\ntools are accessible beyond the end of the Initiative (with WP3); and ensure that local researchers\ncan utilize the tools and government partners can correctly interpret the completed foresight\nanalysis (with WP3).\nWP2 has strong synergies with other Initiatives: its focus on climate is guided by the U2 and\nTAFSSA regional Initiatives; it will work with the regional and National Policies and Strategies\nInitiatives to provide tools and analysis to support policy prioritization within focus countries; and\nits climate analysis will inform the Asian Mega-Deltas, ClimBeR, MITIGATE, and NEXUS Gains\nInitiatives, amongst others.

            "work_package_toc": "Market intelligence used by CGIAR-NARES breeding programs is limited, fragmented and commodity-specific. Moreover, needs of women, indigenous people and minority groups are typically not properly captured. The RICE and RTB CRPs and related bilateral projects (e.g., AGGRi Alliance, AGG, RTBfoods, HarvestPlus) have collected market intelligence, but this has not yet been incorporated in EiB’s current set of product market segments, which reflect current crop environments and need to be prioritized and refined through alignment with value chains and end-markets. \n\nIn order to contribute to EoI Outcomes 1 and 3, and eventually to AA Outcomes 2, 5, 7 and 8, WP1 needs to initiate an institutional change process by building regional, transdisciplinary CGIAR-NARES-SME teams. Strong engagement through a shared vision of increasing the impact of GI through the co-implementation of market intelligence, combined with funding for addressing intelligence gaps, will align CGIAR and partners’ interests and persuade them to build transdisciplinary teams that (i) map current and future global and regional challenges; (ii) translate them into regional opportunities; and (iii) generate the fundamental building blocks of market intelligence that need to be incorporated in gender-intentional product profiles (WP2) and pipeline investment cases (WP4) to capture these opportunities and generate a well-balanced portfolio of impacts across the five Impact Areas. A shared ambition to consolidate and exchange forward-looking information through a novel platform will encourage WP1, WP5, Foresight and Metrics, and Digital Transformation to jointly develop the Global Market Intelligence Platform and monitor its scaling through an Innovation Packages and Scaling Readiness Plan (Section 4). Scaling will be triggered by active demand for market intelligence by demand partners such as GI and other Initiatives (e.g., Accelerated Breeding, SeEdQUAL, Genebanks, Plant Health, Rethinking Food Markets and Value Chains, Excellence in Agronomy, Nature-Positive Solutions, etc.), NARES and public and private sector partners CGIAR Initiative Proposal: Market Intelligence and Product Profiling 17 seeking to improve their strategies and advance their business or development goals through better market intelligence.\n\nFor each region where activity will take place, a regional team comprised of specialists from CGIAR and partners will be formed that is able to engage across crops. Experts from a range of disciplines will be brought together, including social science (gender specialists, economists, consumer and marketing specialists), GIS specialists and climate change experts, agronomists, breeders, among others (e.g., plant pathologists, entomologists, human nutrition scientists) to design shared methods for implementation across regions and crops. Attention will be given to variations in context across crops and regions (e.g., perishability of seed, informal/formal nature of marketing systems, different drivers of product and seed demand, to include consumers, millers, governments and seed companies). The team will engage extensively across all WPs. The regional team building approach is critical to ensure comparability across crops and allow for efficient use of the scarce human resources available for this type of work, which is a first in CGIAR.\n\n At the end of the Initiative, WP1 will achieve the following two outcomes: (i) Regional, transdisciplinary CGIAR-NARES-SME teams in prioritized regions translate global and regional opportunities across the five Impact Areas into market intelligence; (ii) seed companies, food industry and NGOs in targeted regions use and exchange market intelligence. Achieving these outcomes will require strong engagement from partners and a common vision of increasing the impact of genetic innovation systems across the five Impact Areas.\n",

            "work_package_toc": "The use of product profiles to define breeding targets in CGIAR-NARES breeding programs is limited. Existing product profiles focus on replacing existing crop varieties with higher yielding varieties with little consideration of other aspects that could contribute to social impact such as gender equality, opportunities for youth, social inclusion, climate adaptation and mitigation, and reduction of environmental footprint. \n\nTo achieve the institutional change reflected in EoI Outcomes 1 and 2, WP2 will co-develop institutional standards and processes with Accelerated Breeding and Plant Health to establish co-ownership of data collection and market segmentation starting in WP1, and initiate codesign of gender-intentional product profiles among CGIAR and NARES and social and biophysical scientists. The scaling strategy for this institutional innovation will be developed and monitored through an Innovation Package and Scaling Readiness Plan (Section 4). Aligned by a shared interest in increasing the impact of genetic innovation and supported by funding, regional CGIAR-NARES-SME teams of social scientists, economists, gender specialists, plant breeders, food scientists, nutritionists, etc. will incorporate the building blocks of market intelligence from WP1 into a gender-intentional product profile for each product market segment by identifying and prioritizing key traits in each product profile in an inclusive, transparent, and equitable way. With the aim of maximizing future impacts, SeEdQUAL will provide information on traits relevant to seed production and multiplication and traits required for the variety registration process. To align demand with supply, Accelerated Breeding Initiative’s WP1 will assess the feasibility of creating the product defined by the product profile and will update each product profile as needed. If genetic variability in elite germplasm is not adequate, Accelerated Breeding’s WP4 will determine if the needed traits are present in genebanks, and the investment and timeline required to get the traits into elite germplasm. Technical support will be required from the Network 4 Enabling Tools, Technologies, and Shared Services (N4ETTSS) Initiative to convert required “characteristics” into measurable CGIAR Initiative Proposal: Market Intelligence and Product Profiling 21 traits. WP4 will use gender-intentional product profiles to cross check the alignment of pipelines to product market segments and to generate pipeline investment cases. \n\nResearch conducted by WP2 will focus on three areas: (i) institutional standards; (ii) gender intentional product profile design; and (iii) enabling environment (see table). Through a clear engagement process backed by funding, a shared commitment towards increasing impacts of genetic innovation, and jointly developed institutional standards and processes for increasing co-ownership, regional, transdisciplinary CGIAR-NARES-SME teams will be formed and empowered in co-design of gender-intentional product profiles (EoI Outcome 1). Through direct involvement of breeders and other biophysical scientists (e.g., plant health) in the design of product profiles, a sense of co-ownership of the potential impacts of future varieties is generated, which encourages breeding networks to use product profiles as the guiding force for breeding decisions and align breeding pipelines to product market segments. Through strong engagement with SeEdQUAL (WP5) and demonstration of the benefits of product market segmentation, NARES and policy makers become aware of the value of adjusting national product registration trials following product market segments and implement these changes in the policies. These outcomes will contribute to AA Outcomes 2, 5, 7 and 8 and achieving them will crucially hinge on a strong willingness from partners to make product profile design more inclusive, motivated by their ambition to increase and diversify impacts of genetic innovation across the five Impact Areas.\n",

            "work_package_toc": "There are several options for modernizing breeding with competing technologies and tools available. Significant resources are invested in generating data across the CGIAR-NARS breeding network, however, growing misalignment between technologies and tools as programs individually modernize is fragmenting the network, threatening data compatibility and limiting research outcomes. A coordinated breeding network that can share knowledge across regions, needs compatible data for cross and meta-analyses. The need for such global and long-term data sets has never been so pressing. Climate change will require varieties to be assessed under forecast conditions to prioritize parents accordingly and historical and cross-regional breeding results can provide valuable, time saving insights, if the data is available and compatible. \nStrategic Modernization aims to guide informed investment in CGIAR-NARS modernization.  A TTSS Strategic Plan will be developed under the guidance of a multi-stakeholder Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (see WP5 for further details) and be informed by meta-analysis of ABI WP3 BPAT results and extensive regional input to create commitment and ownership. Broad support for the plan will reduce disparate investments in conflicting TTSS and align efforts to maximize the utility and legacy of all breeding research. The TTSS Strategic Plan is a major stage gate and will prompt refinement to all N4ETTSS WPs. The plan will deliver on the Eschborn principles of big lifts, rigorous priority setting, financial realism, transparency and embed principles such as defined success metrics in a shared agenda with stage-gating to further ensure improvements in breeding programs are maximized. \nCrucially, the plan will focus breeding program investments to a common set of TTSS and encourage adoption of TTSS, bringing forth the benefits of breeding modernization. These outcomes will assist ABI, as the main primary beneficiary of N4ETTSS, to maximize its impact on global challenges.\nA model of TTSS investment across the CGIAR-NARS network will inform the TTSS Strategic Plan by identifying the most appropriate package of TTSS for a unified, integrated CGIAR-NARS breeding network that connects with small to medium enterprises. The model will also inform more detailed projection of benefits and MELIA.\nModelling of TTSS in the CGIAR-NARS network will also develop consistent financial forecasting capability for breeding programs. N4ETTSS will harmonize the cost structure of operations across the CGIAR-NARS network. This will support global forecasting, program and portfolio scales of planning with responsiveness to changing demands (e.g. new product profiles) and informed capacity design by CGIAR management. Improved financial acumen will further enable management decisions that improve cost effectiveness of breeding and increase transparency in the value generated by funder investments. \nABI WP3, ABI WP5, EiB’s BPAT results, and this proposal’s regional consultation findings are important inputs to this WP. As ABI expands BPAT-like assessments and modernization plans to NARS, this WP will provide breeding simulations for individual breeding programs (see Annex A for examples). The simulations will inform breeding program decisions, increasing variety performance gains. The value of simulation has been validated at a smaller scale by the EiB Platform, which has piloted such support to champion programs within each crop. A team of quantitative geneticists and biometricians will engage with breeding teams to identify areas that can be improved and be translated into greater genetic and economic performance. The results will validate the benefits of simulations and further encourage TTSS adoption. ",

Use Cases will from a pipeline of projects of 3-4 years, informed by stage-gate decisions on progress made against the delivery of the agronomy-at-scale solutions. Handing over solutions to demand partners will thus free up time for the EiA teams to engage in new Use Cases formulated around new agronomic challenges.\nUse Cases will be aligned to EiA priority research themes: (1) Sustaining soil health and crop productivity and ecosystem services, focusing on site-specific nutrient management, organic matter recycling, and agronomic fortification; (2) Climate change adaptation, focusing on time of planting management, micro-irrigation and water harvesting, risk reduction, and system re-design; (3) Precision cropping system management solutions, focusing on diversification, mechanization, and weed control; and (4) Perennials for livelihoods and conservation, focusing on tree-based systems, greenhouse gas balances, and linking intensification to conservation. EiA’s Incubation Phase already has 10 active Use Cases [EiA_Use_Case_descriptions_2021] and an additional set of at least 10 Use Cases will be activated during the 1st business cycle [EiA_New_Use_Cases_2021].\nEach Use Case is assessed for scaling readiness to ensure that Core Innovations are accompanied with associated complementary innovations and inclusive partnerships. The identification of MVPs will be informed by yield gap analyses and farmer segmentation, and all MVPs will be climate-smart and gender- and youth-responsive. Assumptions underlying the identification and delivery of gender- and youth-responsive agronomic solutions are related to the effectiveness of the Use Case model, the appropriateness of solutions in terms of visible and reliable benefits and the willingness of scaling partners to engage in co-creation processes. Specific MELIA studies are planned to address these assumptions (Section 6.3). One-stop-shops will promote EiA solutions to interested parties through, amongst others, advocacy and engagement in agricultural events. The main partners will be public and private partners leading agricultural development Initiatives with agronomy as a key component. A major assumption is continued investments in agronomic solutions.\nThe DELIVER WP will utilize the prioritization of cropping systems and geographic regions by the ORGANIZE WP (Outputs 4.2 and 4.5). Furthermore, the TRANSFORM WP Outputs 2.2 and 2.4 will be utilized in the formulation and deployment of MVPs within Use Cases. Outputs related to capacity development from the TRANSFORM WP will enable the implementation of gender-transformative strategies by Use Cases. The DELIVER WP will rely on Outputs of other CGIAR Initiatives, namely the Digital Technologies, the HER+, and Plant Health, noting that discussions are on-going with others [EiA_Interactions_Other_Initiatives_2021].",

Validation of performance, and use of these GEd breeding lines in field trials will require prior assurance of freedom from exogenous DNA, and approval from regulatory authorities. To support this, WP3 will develop and use Excellence in Stewardship protocols, a traceability methodology developed, operating procedures to ensure exogenous DNA-free status is maintained and quality assurance processes to give certifiers confidence in the products (2). Within the three years of this Initiative, WP3 will submit at least two products for decision by regulatory authorities about their regulatory status, expecting they will not be subject to GM (transgenic) regulatory requirements (3). \nBy working in CoPs assembled and enabled in WP2, and on GEd products that have been identified through consultation, there will be high levels of co-ownership, user readiness for the products, and enthusiasm to include GEd lines in breeding pipelines and elite varieties (4).  \nThe use of GEd technology to directly edit advanced breeding lines or farmer popular varieties will increase the speed that demand-driven traits can be incorporated into varieties (5). As a result, GEd products will be used to achieve step-change in the targeting Impact Areas and to incorporate the needs of women and youth in market demanded varieties (6, 7).\n",

This WP will work closely with other organizations focused on improving diets, nutrition and health outcomes including local academic partners such as Sokoine University and Wayamba University, Nutrition International, World Food Programme, and Ministries of Health.

            "work_package_toc": "To make progress in increasing F&V intake convenience and desirability issues must be addressed. Context- and population-specific dietary patterns and their drivers need to be characterized and cost-effective behavioral approaches identified and integrated into large-scale programs and embedded into policies. Globally there is an enabling environment to support these efforts. For example, the Healthy Diets Coalition has recently formed and will emphasize three priority areas including, “valuing food: motivating individuals, families and communities to eat healthy diets through multi-dimensional education, information, demand generation and behavior change support”. In preparation for the UNFSS, Sri Lanka, Tanzania and the Philippines highlighted the need for behavioral approaches to address their countries’ nutrition problems suggesting demand for innovative behavioral approaches and an enabling environment for uptake of evidence-based approaches (assumption 1). \nBuilding on this momentum we will use a co-design process based on a 5-step process used successfully by IFPRI and WFP to improve effectiveness of nutrition-sensitive programs at WFP with multi-stakeholder groups in Benin, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Tanzania. These groups will include representatives from other FRESH WPs and our External Advisory Panel and will build from the group of stakeholders who participated in the country stakeholder consultations (Section 2.6). \nBiannual meetings (output 4) will serve as a platform for discussing national priorities and policies, local programs, and contextual factors along with emerging evidence related to F&V, diets, effectiveness of behavioral approaches, and assessment tools, some of which will be generated under SHiFT, Resilient Cities TAFSSA and Her+. The first group task will be selecting priority life-cycle groups (and sub-groups (e.g. urban/rural, SES status)) for the dietary assessments. These will be co-implemented and analyzed with our academic partners like Wayamba University in Sri Lanka (output 1) and will contribute to the country-specific F&V profiles (output 2) and menu of options (output 3). We expect that sharing these outputs will lead to improved understanding by participating agencies of context- and population-specific dietary patterns, barriers to F&V intake, and options for addressing those barriers (outcome 1). This will inform and guide scaling partners, like WFP, to identify opportunities and be willing to implement them along with rigorous impact evaluations (outcome 2). It will also inform and guide local government investments in the implementation and testing of behavioral approaches (outcome 3). Lastly, we expect our academic partners to be interested and willing to collaborate on related impact evaluations (outcome 4). \nBased on the identified opportunities (e.g. in Sri Lanka using FRANI to nudge adolescents to improve diets with or without peer-to-peer learning), a subset of stakeholders (e.g. WFP, Ministry of Education, Foundation for Health Promotion, FRESH WP5) will collaborate to design pilot plans (output 5). If funding, timing and capacity allow (assumption 3), we expect partners like WFP or the Ministry of Education to co-design behavioral approaches and integrate these into their programs (e.g. national awareness campaigns or SAPs) and co-implement comprehensive impact evaluations with FRESH scientists in the four focus countries (EoI outcome 1). These activities, including analysis, will start in year 2 (output 6) and extend to phase 2 to allow sufficient time to impact diets, health, and nutrition outcomes. We will create longitudinal cohorts within the impact evaluations as funding allows to assess long-term impacts. Evaluation results will be disseminated through multiple channels to help guide future investments. \n",

The Accelerated Breeding Initiative is establishing trait development pipelines to systematically search and incorporate valuable diversity into breeding efforts. Hence, the focus of WP 3 is to create resources that connect with and facilitate throughput of those pipelines. The same resources will be useful in trait development efforts from other programs, whether inside or outside CGIAR.\nThe logical flow of information and resources is given in the accompanying diagram. The key beneficiary of genebank work is breeding and selection programs, both inside and outside CGIAR. These establish demand for the genetic diversity preserved in the genebanks. However, connecting this diversity to their programs faces challenges, both in terms of identifying valuable diversity, and in packaging that in a form the breeding programs can utilize. The activities described in WP 3 are aimed at enabling faster, more effective interrogation of genebank materials for useful diversity (phenotypic or allelic), creating genetic resources to relieve the bottlenecks associated with population development, and making such data and materials easily accessible to researchers. Together these activities will enable more efficient evaluation of genebank collections, thereby lowering barriers to Accelerated Breeding Initiative and external partners utilizing the collections.\nThe work of the Genebanks Initiative on enhanced use of germplasm extends beyond One CGIAR, particularly in terms of the direct use of non-mandated crops in partnerships with other actors involved in value chain development.",

The proposed work will generate urgently needed evidence on the state and key drivers of, and inequalities in, consumption of sustainable healthy diets and nutrition and health outcomes (output 1) and develop standardized indicators, tools, and metrics (output 2). Evidence will be used to stimulate interest among demand and innovation stakeholders to co-create and test scalable consumer and FE policies and innovations (output 3) and to implement the most promising and scalable ones in their country. By 2024, we expect that stakeholders initiate implementation of at least two innovations or policies to increase the demand for sustainable healthy diets in four target countries (EoI outcome 1), especially among women, youth, and other marginalized groups (EoI outcome 6).\n\nAchieving these outcome will depend on the following assumptions being met (or mitigation measures adopted): (1) that planned data collection is possible in all target countries (Section 7.3, risk 5); (2) that SHiFT will succeed in establishing trust and fruitful collaboration with relevant partners (Section 7.3, risk 1a); (3) that SHiFT effectively addresses gender, youth, and social inclusion (Section 7.3, risk 3); and (4) that SHiFT’s early and continued engagement with relevant stakeholders and efforts to strengthen their capacity facilitates learning and willingness to co-create and implement promising innovations and policies supported by adequate resources in their respective countries.\n\nWe will first work with demand partners (e.g., agriculture and health ministries, nutrition units, gender and social development units, consumer groups, civil society, etc.) and innovation partners (local research institutions, universities, data collection firms, local and international NGOs, UN institutions, and FE actors) to inform a comprehensive view of the nutrition and diet landscape and develop a policy research agenda. Local research partners and data collection firms along with international research and academic partners will actively participate in the research implementation stage to develop, adapt, and validate methods, tools, and metrics (e.g., IMMANA/LHSTM; INSP; INDDEX Project; Intake, etc.). The evidence generated will be disseminated, discussed, and understood by stakeholders (outcome within Initiative timeline (OWIT) 1). Key demand and innovation partners (including new partners such as GAIN, Rockefeller Foundation FS-TIP, USAID Food System Innovation Lab, etc.) will be willing to use the evidence generated by SHiFT to co-create scalable consumer and FE policies and innovations and to plan causal evaluations to assess impacts, pathways of impact, and cost effectiveness (OWIT 2) (Section 6.3 causal impact assessment). Impact evidence will be synthesized and disseminated among all our partners (demand, innovation, and scaling) who will understand this evidence and will be willing to use it to design and implement policies and innovations to achieve sustainable healthy diets for all (OWIT 3). If our assumptions are met and our OWITs achieved, we expect that by 2024, stakeholders will initiate implementation of innovations and policies to increase the demand for sustainable healthy diets in four target countries (EoI outcome 1) and that these innovations or policies will tackle gender and youth equality and social inclusion in food systems (EoI outcome 6).\n\nThe data, evidence, tools, metrics, and methods generated (outputs 1–3) will feed into SHiFT’s Food System Learning Center (Innovation 1); into WP2, helping FE actors deliver and promote sustainable nutritious foods; and into WP 3–5, using the evidence and learning when analyzing policies and trade-offs and developing context-specific transformative pathways. We will also collaborate on tools and metrics development and share research findings with other One CGIAR Initiatives that include a focus on consumers and sustainable healthy diets (e.g., FRESH; Resilient Cities; TAFSSA, Ukama Ustawi (U2)). We will promote the use of and encourage contributions to the Learning Center (Innovation 1) from these and other Initiatives that incorporate consumer demand considerations in their work.",

In the 2022–2024 cycle, WP1 will <strong>help AFS stakeholders identify leverage points and levers to reduce normative constraints </strong>that limit women’s capacities to build economic resilience to CC challenges. The evidence will be used to <strong>design and implement GTAs</strong> with CGIAR Initiatives and partners to overcome these constraints. WP1 will help harness and package the learning to accelerate widespread application of GTAs within the AR4D ecosystem. </p><p>  </p>",

            "work_package_toc": "The purpose of ReFOCUS is to achieve greater focus of CGIAR breeding by working with MIPP to better define product profiles aligned to distinct market segments and target environments; and rationalize and align CGIAR breeding pipeline structures and investments – individually and combined as a portfolio --for greatest and most probable contributions to the five CGIAR impact goals.\nThe demand for greater focus and clearer prioritization comes from funders and national governments investing public or philanthropic funds into breeding, and from research leaders, breeders and seed companies wanting to invest scarce resources to achieve maximum impact. The CGIAR currently has a portfolio including over 135 product profiles across 24 crops. Breeding pipelines pursue traits related to greater productivity, resilience (to pests and diseases, weather variability and climate change), biofortification (for pro-vitamin A, zinc and iron), reduced greenhouse gas emission, labor-saving or distinct end uses.\nWorking closely with MIPP and drawing N4ETTS tools and services, ReFOCUS will (i) assess realistic breeding ambitions and associated investments to help define the portfolio of achievable product profiles that the CGIAR-NARES-SME breeding teams commit to develop within a certain time frame, (ii) structure breeding pipelines so that each are aligned with a defined product profile(s), market segment and targeted impact(s).\nThe key 2024 Outcome - CGIAR-NARES breeding pipelines oriented towards specific market segments, enabling greater focus on farmers’ needs, drivers of adoption, and impact - is anticipated to be achieved through four interlinked pathways:\nA. Orientation towards greater adoption: By CGIAR and NARES breeders working with social scientists (MIPP) and the seed sector (SeEdQUAL) in revising product profiles aligned to market demands, impact opportunities and drivers of adoption, product profiles will become the driving force for all breeding decisions within CGIAR-NARES-SME breeding networks. They determine the traits evaluated and used at each stage of selection, and the relative emphasis given between traits, leading to varieties that will more likely be adopted.\nB. Systematizing client-led validation: By linking in with SeEdQUAL for client-feedback during on-farm trialing and scale-out, product profiles can be purposefully adjusted and selection emphases shifted. Client-led validation will become a systematized component of the breeding process, and help to evolve the portfolio of targeted product profiles.\nC. Transparency driving breeding investments: By linking breeding investments and distinct target markets to most likely development impacts on MIPP’s Investor Dashboard, transparency is being created that will allow investors, national governments, and implementers to confidently allocate resources to distinct pipeline investment cases.\nD. A system change for targeting: By NARES and SMEs actively participating in the product profile definition, knowledge for defining and prioritizing product profiles will flow to the NARES and SMEs; they will increase the adoption of these concepts in their own breeding programs.\nReFOCUS will co-develop Innovation Packages for all four Pathways with MIPP’s Institutional Innovation and G×I Learning Alliance (also including PHRRFLS and SeEdQUAL) (2 core innovations).",
